        I am a Master's Student focusing in GISciences at Texas State University,
        which is also where I received my Bachelor's of Science in Geography focusing
        on Environment and Resource Management Studies. Go Bobcats!
        Currently, I intern with the Texas Division of Emergency Management
        supporting the Critical Information Systems GIS Team during disaster activations.
